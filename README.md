# A2_CAR
Scripts for analysing data and generating figures for the A2-CAR-T cell manuscript. 
Figures 1, 3, and 5B, as well as supplementary figures S2-S7, were generated using the scripts found here. 

Each figure script contains code for wrangling the data (included as text files), 
performing the statistical analyses, and generating figures. Figures were then assembled using the patchwork package and saved as
svg files. Small changes were made to the svg files using Inkscape.

Figures 1 and S2-S3 use the raw data in the folder Figure1_data. Figures 3 and S4-S7 use the raw data in Figure3_data.
